# Algorithms

### Here I learn algorithms and their implementation.

My plan is:

- Solve problems from ["Introduction to Algorithms"](https://github.com/AigerimJ/algorithms/blob/master/Books/Thomas%20H.%20Cormen%2C%20Charles%20E.%20Leiserson%2C%20Ronald%20L.%20Rivest%2C%20Clifford%20Stein%20-%20Introduction%20to%20algorithms-The%20MIT%20Press%20(2009).pdf) book.
